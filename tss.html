            A personal favorite of mine, <i>Two Spools of my Soul</i> is an introspection of my identity as a Filipino-American.
            It depicts the two parts of my identity being woven together, despite spending most of my life believing they are 
            two separate aspects of myself. My American nationality and my Filipino heritage rarely collided since I was born and
            raised in America, a long distance away from my ethic culture. This piece portrays my nationality and ethnicity joining to create me, a blank
            canvas of potential, who is learning to connect these two parts of me and explore what each of them hold.

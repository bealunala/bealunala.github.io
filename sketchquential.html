    Collaborating with a group of students, we crafted a collaborative drawing card game.<br>
    Work with the collective to draw randomly selected prompts before time runs out!<br>
    User Manual:<br>
    Setup:<br>
    - Split cards into respective colors and categories<br>
    - Shuffle the cards well<br>
    - Form a circle facing outwards<br>
    What to Draw?<br>
    - Pull one prompt card of each color (blue: adjective, yellow: noun, red: verb/action)<br>
    - Assemble into full prompt, Madlib-style: blue, yellow, red<br>
    - The player who pulled the prompt pulls a piece of drawing paper, marking it with
    one tally in the corner<br>
    Let’s Start!<br>
    - They then pass the marked piece of drawing paper to the player to their right and start counting:<br>
    - everyone not drawing counts to (approximately):<br>
    - Easy: 20 sec<br>
    - Intermediate: 10 sec<br>
    - Hard: 5 sec<br>
    - Once the countdown is over, the drawing is passed clockwise<br>
    - Each cycle, the person who pulled the prompt must quickly mark the paper with
    another tally before passing it on. Game is complete after five cycles<br>

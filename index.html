                <h3>My passion stems from a need to create thoughtful experiences that inspires deeper thought.</h3>
                <p>
                    From a young age, I’ve been passionate about creating art inspired by the many facets of my life. Now, 
                    as a Computer Science and Design student at Northeastern University, I’m exploring the powerful 
                    intersection between art and technology and the ways they can elevate one another. With a minor in 
                    Writing, my interest in storytelling drives me to craft digital experiences that spark reflection and 
                    inspire thoughtful conversations. As I deepen my skills in Java and other programming languages, 
                    my goal is to create interactive experiences that captivate users and encourage them to see 
                    themselves—and the world—through a new lens.

                    In Processing, I created a simple game about a little sentient flame who is stuck in the

                        Exploring the translation from an analog interaction (making coffee with a coffee machine)
                        to a digital interface. How does one replicate the user's experience of something physical within 
                        a digital space? To tackle this question, I __ BrewIt, a mobile app based off Netflix's UI that 
                        lets the user browse and brew coffee.

                        Taking inspiration is essentially a flattering version of stealing. I forgot who said
                        it, but all good artists <b>are</b> "thieves," in the most basic sense of the word.
                        I find a lot of words are doomed to carry the burden of human connotations, even though
                        fundamentally, they are not good nor bad. i.e. manipulation. shout out my high school 
                        English Capstone classmate for getting me to rethink my conception of manipulation. go lions ig!!

                <h3>My passion lies in creating meaningful experiences that inspire reflection and foster connection.</h3>
                <p>
                    From a young age, I've been passionate about creating art inspired by the many facets of my life. Now, 
                    as a Computer Science and Design student at Northeastern University, I'm exploring the powerful 
                    intersection between art and technology and the ways they can elevate one another. With a minor in 
                    Writing, my interest in storytelling drives me to craft digital experiences that spark reflection and 
                    inspire thoughtful conversations. As I deepen my skills in Java and other programming languages, 
                    my goal is to create interactive experiences that captivate users and encourage them to see 
                    themselves–and the world–through a new lens.

                        I chose "scattered." My first year of college was a busy one, as most students' are, and learning to balance my well-being 
                        along with my physical health, my classwork workloads, my relationships with friends, and my family, and myself, left me feeling... 
                        well, scattered! Art has always been an outlet for my raw emotions, so I let the colors of my frustration bleed onto this paper.

                        As much as I love working at cafes with friends as much as the next college student, I 
                        dislike how, in search of a third space, we pay a 10ish dollar ticket (coffee) just to 
                        sit at a cramped table and type away at our computers for hours, rarely stopping to enjoy 
                        the taste of the coffee or the ambience of the espresso machine clacking or the people chattering. Maybe that's 
                        just the cycle I've found myself in as I started to drink coffee out of necessity rather than 
                        out of enjoyment. I just want my third spaces to feel like third spaces again: an informal, comfortable 
                        oasis. A break from work and school and life.

                        Taking inspiration is essentially a flattering version of stealing. I forgot who said
                        it, but all good artists <b>are</b> "thieves," in the most basic sense of the word.
                        I find a lot of words are doomed to carry the burden of human connotations, even though
                        fundamentally, they are not good nor bad. i.e. manipulation. shoutout my high school 
                        English Capstone classmate for getting me to rethink my conception of manipulation. go lions ig!!

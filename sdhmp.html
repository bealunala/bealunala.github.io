        This piece is a self portrait created with words: more specifically, words from my journal entries throughout 
        the years. I titled this piece "Saint Dymphna, Hear my Prayers" to pay homage to my patron saint, Saint Dymphna, 
        when I became a confirmed Catholic my sophomore year. My words act as a prayer of sorts since I journal in order 
        to find peace and clarity with my emotions during troubling times.

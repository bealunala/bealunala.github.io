            My art professor challenged my classmates and I to create a self portrait using objects that hold meaning to us.
            While doubling as a value study, I decided to create a composition of my various notebooks, all containers of my 
            random spurts of inspiration, brainstorming, task tracking, and the like. While my notebooks are a scribbled mess, 
            they keep me organized and attentive.

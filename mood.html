            My art professor challenged my classmates and I to create a self portrait inspired by one emotional word of our choosing.
            I chose "scattered." My first year of college was a busy one, as most students' are, and learning to balance my well-being
            along with my physical health, my classwork workloads, my relationships with friends, and my family, and myself, left me feeling... well, scattered! Art
            has always been an outlet for my raw emotions, so I let the colors of my frustration bleed onto this paper.
